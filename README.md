## Overview

Welcome to my learning journey through the Docker and Kubernetes Mastery Course. This course covers Docker and Kubernetes, offering a hands-on guide to creating and deploying web applications efficiently.

I started from scratch, understanding what containers are and how they work. I also learned to implement a robust CI + CD workflow using GitHub, Travis CI, and AWS.

During the course, I successfully deployed both single-container and multi-container applications on Amazon Web Services. I also built a Kubernetes Cluster on my local machine and deployed a production-ready Kubernetes Cluster on Google Cloud. The course provided practical insights without the typical "don't do this in production" warnings.
